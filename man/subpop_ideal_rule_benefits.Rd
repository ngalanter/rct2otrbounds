\item{mean_0}{mean outcome of the control group}

\item{s_prop_low}{lowest relative size of the subpopulation to plot, default is 0.1}

\item{m, M}{two real numbers defining the outcome range with \code{m}<\code{M}}

\item{level}{confidence level between 0 and 1 for confidence interval;
default is 0.95}

default is \code{FALSE}}

\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimate} the estimated benefit of the ideal treatment rule over the best uniform treatment
\item \code{conf.upper} The \code{level} upper confidence bound if \code{conf.upper} is TRUE, \code{NULL} otherwise
