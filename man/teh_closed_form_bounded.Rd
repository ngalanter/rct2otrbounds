\arguments{
\item{m, M}{two real numbers defining the outcome range with \code{m}<\code{M}}

\item{s2_1}{estimated outcome variance of the treatment group}

\item{s2_0}{estimated outcome variance of the control group}

\item{n_1}{sample size of the treatment group}

\item{n_0}{sample size of the control group}

\item{mean_1}{mean outcome of the treatment group}

\item{mean_0}{mean outcome of the control group}

\item{conf.int}{whether a confidence interval is generated}

\item{level}{confidence level between 0 and 1 for confidence interval
default is 0.95}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimates} a two element vector of the estimated lower and upper bounds on
treatment effect heterogeneity
\item \code{conf.int} a two element vector of the \code{level} confidence interval around the bounds,
for bounded outcomes when the \code{conf.int} argument is set to TRUE
}
