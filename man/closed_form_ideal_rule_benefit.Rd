\arguments{
\item{s2_1}{estimated outcome variance of the treatment group}

\item{s2_0}{estimated outcome variance of the control group}

\item{n_1}{sample size of the treatment group}

\item{n_0}{sample size of the control group}

\item{mean_1}{mean outcome of the treatment group}

\item{mean_0}{mean outcome of the control group}

\item{m, M}{two real numbers defining the outcome range with \code{m}<\code{M}}

\item{level}{confidence level between 0 and 1 for confidence interval;
default is 0.95}

\item{bounded_outcome}{logical; \code{TRUE} if the outcome is bounded and \code{FALSE} otherwise,
default is \code{FALSE}}

\item{conf.upper}{logical; whether a upper confidence bound should be provided}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{estimate} the estimated benefit of the ideal treatment rule over the best uniform treatment
\item \code{conf.upper} The \code{level} upper confidence bound if \code{conf.upper} is TRUE, \code{NULL} otherwise
}
